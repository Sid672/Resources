You love coding, but don't know where to start. That's why we have build resources for you. You like to learn and experiment, So one day while I was surfing on the web. When I was like you as a newbie as a programmer. I randomly landed up the few sites found very useful, and you will find these websites really helpful.

I know we all are different, and some like to learn from ebooks, websites, and videos e.t.c
So, I will list them below.

All the best! 👍🏻

**One can read a book and learn about the basics of CP :**

Book link: @[https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

To get maximum from the book, read some part then apply it. One can switch to the next chapter if one feels confident about the topics. Revision of topics is also important to build up strong muscle memory. 

**Key points:**

1) Patience (because it's takes time)

2) Enjoy learning new things.

> Discussion :

If you want to discuss questions, you can ask on the slack #code channel.
